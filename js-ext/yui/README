This release introduces six new components into YUI:

This update contains one change.  We have reverted the change to the way the Event Utility cleans up

*** version 0.10.0 ***

In this release, the directory structure has been modified to provide more
component organization.  This is the new format:

yui/
  |
  -- build/
  | |
  | -- dom/
  | |
  | | -- assets/
  | |
  | | -- dom.js
  | |
  -- docs/
  | |
  | -- dom/
  | |
  -- examples/
  | |
  | -- dom/
  | |
  | | -- img/

Notice there are three immediate directories under the
root YUI.  They are:

*build/*
This directory contains the source files for each YUI component, and each
component is presented as a sub-directory under build/.  Notice that there are
generally two source files: component.js and component-min.js.  The "component"
source is the raw, commented build and "component-min" is the minified version
of the same file with comments and whitespace removed.  With some components,
there is an assets sub-directory.  CSS and image dependencies for each
component are stored in its assets sub-directory.

Note: If a component makes use of images, the image source path in the
component's CSS file will point to Akamai.  The physical images are also
available in the assets/ directory for local availability.  Please modify the
CSS image references if you wish to use your own image assets.

*docs/*
This directory contains the jsdoc-generated API reference for every YUI
component.  Each component is presented as a sub-directory under docs/.

*examples/*
This directory contains functional examples for each component in the YUI
Library.  The examples are not part of the formal distribution; rather,
they provide demonstrations of each component in use.  Each example uses YUI
Library source files from the build/ directory, while all example-specific
dependencies are stored in sub-directories (e.g. examples/dom/img).
Some components, including the AutoComplete Control and Connection Manager,
make use of PHP to implement certain examples.

For example:
In yui/examples/dom, the dom.js source file and all YUI .js dependencies
are drawn from yui/build/ directories.  All other example-specific sources are
stored as sub-directories: yui/examples/dom/css and yui/examples/dom/img.

Each functional example is also available and functional on
developer.yahoo.com/yui/.  They reproduced here as part of the distribution
for your convenience.
